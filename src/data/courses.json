    "description": "Malware analysis is a specialization within cyber security. Malware attacks are often detrimental to companies or organizations. When malware breaches an organization's defences, the security team needs to act quickly to cure current infections and prevent it from re-occurring. Understanding the capabilities of the malware is critical to an organization's ability to quickly create a signature to prevent the widespread of the malware across the network, to block further communications from the attacker. This understanding could also be translated to valuable knowledge in identifying existing security gaps within an organization's system and fortify defences. This course aims to build a strong foundation to perform triage on malicious software using a variety of system and network monitoring utilities, a disassembler, a debugger and many other freely available tools.",

Cyber physical systems are the driving force behind modern civilization, being integral part of technologies, such as additive manufacturing, smartcard-based payment, power delivery systems, drone-based operations, and smart home automation. Cyber physical systems are characterized by stringent performance requirements, such as, extremely low energy budget, small area footprint and often hard real-time constraints.

In this course, we will learn about the basics of cyber physical systems, including the design principles and methodologies. Further, there will be a detailed treatment of the security challenges for cyber physical systems, which vary in practice due to the diverse nature of the application environment of cyber physical systems. These different forms of security breaches, observed across diverse cyber physical systems, will be put in a well-characterized taxonomy, to be systematically identified as attack surfaces. The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication.

    "description": "Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein & Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication. While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when you communicate.",

    "description": "Sustainability stresses the importance of future development to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. This concept is a culmination of economic, environmental, and social discourse throughout the last few decades. The United Nations (UN) declared a Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD) with the aim to promote ?a more sustainable world through different forms of education, training and public awareness activities?. This provides an opportunity to reconsider approaches undertaken to address global challenges. It is imperative that pedagogical directions for higher education institutions address the foundations of sustainable development across different disciplines due to its complex and multi-faceted nature that encompasses a full spectrum of socio-economic-environmental issues. As such, this course aims to stimulate critical thinking, curiosity, and the ability to structure and synthesise knowledge through the lens of sustainability. Learning will be reinforced by concrete case studies with a focus on topics such as resource management, pollution, responsible consumption, and climate change. The course will require systematic analyses of major current sustainability challenges from the perspectives of society, economy, and the environment, and look at how we can promote a more sustainable world through choices and actions, as individuals, societies, nations, and as a global community. Through this learning process, students will acquire a systems thinking approach to sustainability that enhances knowledge and skills sets relevant to various disciplines and career paths. This course hopes to inspire and equip students to be agents of change toward a more sustainable world.",

These may include systems engineering and design, large-scale web systems, embedded systems development tools, etc. In their implementation, students will have to factor in appropriate considerations for public health and safety, cultural, societal factors, environmental and other constraints as well as the needs for sustainable development. Laboratories - Laboratory during MDP will be a mixed of guided and open accessed sessions. Teams - Students will be grouped into teams of about 6-7 member.
